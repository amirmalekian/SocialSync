## üöÄGetting Started

1. Sign up in one of the Cloud computing services sites (I used [Liara](https://liara.ir/)) and get `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` and `DB_PORT`.

2. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirmalekian/SocialSync.git
```

3. Install project dependencies for both the api folder and the client

```bash
npm install
#or
yarn add
```

4. Add `.env` file to root api folder project, and enter your‚Äç ‚Äç`PORT`, `JWT_KEY` with Database information  into `.env`

```js
PORT=[ENTER YOUR DESIRED PORT]
JWT_KEY=[ENTER YOUR TOKEN]
DB_HOST=[ENTER YOUR DB_HOST]
.
.
.
```

5. Run the development server for both the api and client in the root path of both folders:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
